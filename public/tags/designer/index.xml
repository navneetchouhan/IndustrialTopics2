      <description>As a designer, what challenges I had faced in the beginning As an electronics student, I faced so many difficulty while starting this career. One moment it was like a challenge for me and the next moment it seems so interesting to me.
The question here arises is why was it seems to be challenge to me? Umm, the answer for this would be that I was not good in designing and I donâ€™t have any knowledge about designs and creativity because I was so bad in drawing stuff.</description>
