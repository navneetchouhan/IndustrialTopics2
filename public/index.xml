      <description>Challenges We face during Redesigning of website   The designing now-a-days are at its peak and for the competition, designers need to focus on being technical as well as they should adopt some strategies. I and my team had redesigned a website in the second semester in Project 1. We redesigned it so well that our client was very impressed with our work but rather than that we faced few problems during redesigning of their website.</description>

      <description>As a designer, what challenges I had faced in the beginning   As an electronics student, I faced so many difficulty while starting this career. One moment it was like a challenge for me and the next moment it seems so interesting to me.
The question here arises is why was it seems to be challenge to me? Umm, the answer for this would be that I was not good in designing and I donâ€™t have any knowledge about designs and creativity because I was so bad in drawing stuff.</description>
